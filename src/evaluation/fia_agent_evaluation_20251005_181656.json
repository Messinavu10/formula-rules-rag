The lower plate of the Energy Store assembly is considered to be part of the Survival cell. Cockpit padding includes non-structural parts placed within the cockpit for the sole purpose of improving driver comfort and safety.",
          "Article 14: Safety Equipment - All cars must be fitted with a fire extinguishing system which will discharge into the cockpit and into the engine compartment. The fire extinguishing system must be approved according to FIA standards. Cars must also have rear view mirrors, safety harnesses, and rear lights.",

        ],
        "response": "The safety requirements for Formula 1 cars, as outlined in the 2025 Technical Regulations, include several critical components designed to enhance driver safety and improve emergency response during races. Here are the key safety requirements:\n\n1. **High-Speed Camera**: Each Formula 1 car must be equipped with a high-speed camera manufactured by a supplier designated by the FIA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile). This camera must be installed according to specific FIA guidelines (Article 8.10.3). The data collected from these cameras is vital for analyzing accidents and improving safety measures.\n\n2. **In-Ear Accelerometers**: Drivers are required to wear in-ear accelerometers, also sourced from an FIA-designated supplier. These devices monitor the driver's physical condition, particularly during high-stress situations, helping to assess the impact of forces experienced during a race (Article 8.10.4).\n\n3. **Biometric Device**: Each driver must wear a biometric device that aids in rescue operations. This device provides essential health information to medical teams in the event of an accident. An exemption from this requirement can be granted by the FIA under certain circumstances (Article 8.10.5).\n\nThese regulations are crucial for enhancing the safety of drivers during races and ensuring that medical teams can respond quickly and effectively in emergencies. The integration of technology such as high-speed cameras and biometric devices reflects the ongoing commitment to improving safety standards in Formula 1 racing.",

        ],
        "response": "In Formula 1, engine power limits are governed by specific regulations that dictate how power can be managed and delivered during races. According to the 2026 Technical Regulations, the following key points outline the power limits:\n\n1. **Maximum Power Demand Reduction**:\n   - For races where the power limited distance exceeds 3500 meters, the maximum power demand from the driver can be reduced by no more than **50 kW** in any 1-second period.\n   - For all other races, this reduction is limited to **100 kW** in any 1-second period.\n\n2. **Total Power Reduction**:\n   - The total power reduction allowed is capped at **450 kW**. This means that teams must manage their engine output carefully to stay within this limit.\n\n3. **Electrical Power from ERS-K**:\n   - The electrical DC power output from the Energy Recovery System (ERS-K) must remain above **-100 kW**. This ensures that the energy recovery systems contribute positively to the vehicle's performance rather than detracting from it.\n\nThese regulations are designed to ensure that teams can effectively manage engine performance while also promoting efficiency and sustainability in the sport. The limits on power demand and recovery are crucial for strategic planning during races, influencing how teams deploy their engine power throughout the event.",

The engine high rev limits must remain within a band of 750rpm as specified in Article C5.14 of the 2026 Technical Regulations.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you prepare it perfectly:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- Pasta (any type you prefer)\n- Water\n- Salt\n- Optional: Olive oil or butter, sauce of your choice\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Boil Water:**\n   - Fill a large pot with water. Use about 4-6 quarts of water for every pound of pasta.\n   - Add a generous amount of salt (about 1-2 tablespoons) to the water. This enhances the flavor of the pasta.\n   - Bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat.\n\n2. **Add Pasta:**\n   - Once the water is boiling, add the pasta. Stir it gently to prevent it from sticking together.\n   - Check the package instructions for the recommended cooking time.\n\n3. **Cook the Pasta:**\n   - Let the pasta cook uncovered at a rolling boil. Stir occasionally.\n   - Taste the pasta a minute or two before the package time is up to check for doneness. It should be al dente, meaning it should be firm to the bite but not hard.\n\n4. **Drain the Pasta:**\n   - Once cooked, turn off the heat and carefully drain the pasta in a colander. Do not rinse the pasta unless you are making a cold pasta salad, as rinsing removes the starch that helps sauce adhere.\n\n5. **Add Sauce:**\n   - If you\u2019re using a sauce, return the drained pasta to the pot or a pan, add your sauce, and toss to combine. You can also add a splash of pasta water to help the sauce cling better.\n\n6. **Serve:**\n   - Serve the pasta hot, garnished with cheese, herbs, or any additional toppings you like.\n\n### Tips:\n- For added flavor, you can add a splash of olive oil to the boiling water or toss the pasta with olive oil or butter after draining.\n- Experiment with different types of pasta and sauces to find your favorite combinations!\n\nEnjoy your delicious homemade pasta!",
